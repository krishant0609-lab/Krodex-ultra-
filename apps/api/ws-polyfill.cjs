/**
 * KRODEX API — Node 20 WebSocket polyfill loader.
 *
 * Node 20 ships without a global `WebSocket`. @supabase/supabase-js@2.45.x
 * instantiates a Realtime client inside `createClient()`, and the realtime-js
 * WebSocket factory requires the global. On Node 20 this throws:
 *
 *   Error: Node.js detected but native WebSocket not found.
 *   Suggested solution: Ensure you are running Node.js 22+ or provide a
 *   WebSocket implementation via the transport option.
 *
 * Until the Railway runtime is bumped to Node 22, install a `ws` polyfill
 * on `globalThis.WebSocket` before the API source is loaded. `ws` is
 * already a transitive dep (pulled in by Next.js dev tooling), so no
 * new package is added.
 *
 * This file is a packaging shim only. It is invoked by the Procfile
 * (`node -r ./apps/api/ws-polyfill.cjs ...` style) and never imported
 * by application code.
